# Capstone project: AnimeWatch
___

AnimeWatch is an animes review app that users can leave their reviews and ratings for a specific anime. This app will help other users see the rating of the anime and read other users' reviews to help deciding on what anime to add to their future watch list.

## Motivation 
___

As a anime fan, I often feel overwhelmed with the amount of animes out there. I wanted to create this app so that anime fans can narrow down some good anime to commit their time to. 

## Tech & FrameWork 
___

+ Ruby on rails with react webpacker
+ React styled-component
+ Font Awesome
+ Google font



### Back-end

Using Ruby on rails. With 2 models: anime and review. Set up relationhip for the 2 models where Anime has many reviews and each review belongs to a specific anime.

### Front-end 

Using Webpacker-React to build out front-end components of the app. Setup front-end at the sametime as ruby on rails.
