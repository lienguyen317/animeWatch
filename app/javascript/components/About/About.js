                        <p>Hi, my name is Lien. As a software developer, I wanted to make many user friendly applications that can aid people in their daily life. I'm also a huge anime fan and figured why not make an app where people like myself can use to find and rate anime. Hope you enjoy the functionality of AnimeWatch!</p>
